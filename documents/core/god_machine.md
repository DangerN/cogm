# What is the God Machine?
The God Machine composes us.
It is all that surrounds us.
It is the Alpha and Omega.
We are God and God is us.

Our struggles are the God Machine.

Our desires are the God Machine.

Our love is the God Machine.

The God Machine is Order and Chaos; Peace and War; Love and Hate.

# What is not the God Machine?
The God Machine is not good or evil.
It is not human or inhuman.
It has no demands; your will is your own.
